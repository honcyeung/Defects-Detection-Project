# Defects Detection Project with Deep Learning

This project is to establish a neural netork, trained with a number of images with 6 metallic surface defects, to test and predict an image with defects. By feeding different numbers of image to the network and adjusting various parameters, we can test the accuracy of the network. The 6 defects are as follows:

- 0: Crazing
- 1: Inclusions
- 2: Patches
- 3: Pitted Surface
- 4: Rolled in Scale
- 5: Scratches

I first import the train and test image data to train the neural network. Then I display some of the images to examine them. A neural network is built and iamges are fed in it to predict the outcomes.
